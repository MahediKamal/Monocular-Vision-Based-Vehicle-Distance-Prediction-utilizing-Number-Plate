# work 1 - (calculating distance of car using single camera)
We have 5 types of dataset-


```
  1. still car image taken by 48 mp camera
  2. moving car back view taken by samsung galaxcy A12
  3. moving car front fiew taken by samsung galaxcy A12
  4. moving car back view taken by Iphone 13
  5. moving car front fiew taken by Iphone 13
```

We will calculate distance predicting accuracy for each of the 5 type of dataset individually.

## 1. still car image taken by 48 mp camera
### model link
### accuracy
### result image

## 2. moving car back view taken by samsung galaxcy A12
### model link
### accuracy
### result image

## 3. moving car front fiew taken by samsung galaxcy A12
### model link
### accuracy
### result image

## 4. moving car back view taken by Iphone 13
### model link
### accuracy
### result image

## 5. moving car front fiew taken by Iphone 13
### model link
### accuracy
### result image

# work 2 - (creating a model that can detect some native vehiche of bangladesh and then compare the model with COCO model)

Our model can recognize-
```
  0. human
  1. car
  2. bus
  3. rickshaw
  4. bike
  5. cng
  6. bicycle
  7. van
  8. easybike
```
